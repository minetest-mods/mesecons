--[[
Mesecons uses something it calls an ActionQueue.

The ActionQueue holds functions and actions.
Functions are added on load time with a specified name.
Actions are preserved over server restarts.

Each action consists of a position, the name of an added function to be called,
the params that should be used in this function call (additionally to the pos),
the time after which it should be executed, an optional overwritecheck and a
priority.

If time = 0, the action will be executed in the next globalstep, otherwise the
earliest globalstep when it will be executed is the after next globalstep.

It is guaranteed, that for two actions ac1, ac2 where ac1 ~= ac2,
ac1.time == ac2.time, ac1.priority == ac2.priority and ac1 was added earlier
than ac2, ac1 will be executed before ac2 (but in the same globalstep).

Note: Do not pass references in params, as they can not be preserved.

Also note: Some of the guarantees here might be dropped at some time.
