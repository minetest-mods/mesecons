The Scanner detects how many slots are occupied in the inventory of the node behind it
and outputs a signal according to its configuration. Right click on the Scanner to configure it.
The default configuration is to output a signal if the scanned inventory contain any items.

The Scanner will return its output signal status upon receiving a Digiline "GET" command and
send a message on the channel when the output state changes.
